Be sure to have a copy of the Bootstrap stylesheet available on your application, you can get it on http://getbootstrap.com/.

Inside your views, use the 'simple_form_for' with one of the Bootstrap form classes, '.form-horizontal' or '.form-inline', as the following:

= simple_form_for(@user, html: { class: 'form-horizontal' }) do |form|
